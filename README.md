# SecureAIExam 🛡️

National-scale secure examination platform — eliminates question paper leaks for NEET, UPSC and Board exams by removing every single point of failure.

**This build adds:** a redesigned UI with a live **light/dark toggle** (sun/moon icon in every header, persisted), teacher question upload for **both MCQ and theoretical** questions, **PDF question import with NLP** (Claude + offline fallback), a **QR-stamped printable question paper with print preview**, **dynamic exam scheduling** (2–3 daily slots with start/end/duration), and **exam-center custody**: the Admin provisions a **center login** (code + password), copies are allocated centerwise, the **invigilator scans each QR** (camera or paste) which verifies it, clears it from the pending set, and **notifies the Admin in real time**, and any **unscanned copies raise a CRITICAL alert ~20 min before the slot**. All lists (subjects, filters, paper composition) are data-driven — no hardcoded categories.

---

## 1. Supabase setup (one time)

1. Create a free project at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com).
2. Open **SQL Editor** → paste the entire contents of [`supabase/schema.sql`](supabase/schema.sql) → **Run**. (Run once on a fresh project.)
   > **Already ran schema.sql before?** Run, in order, [`supabase/patch-1-digest-and-exams.sql`](supabase/patch-1-digest-and-exams.sql) (fixes the `digest()` sealing error + adds exam categories), [`supabase/patch-2-question-types.sql`](supabase/patch-2-question-types.sql) (MCQ **and** theoretical question types, per-question marks, PDF-sourced questions), [`supabase/patch-3-centers-and-scan.sql`](supabase/patch-3-centers-and-scan.sql) (exam centers, per-copy allocation, invigilator scan-in, pre-exam reconciliation), and [`supabase/patch-4-slots-and-invigilator.sql`](supabase/patch-4-slots-and-invigilator.sql) (dynamic exam slots + the invigilator/center login role). All are idempotent. *(patch-4 adds an enum value — if Supabase complains about "unsafe use of new value of enum type", run that first `ALTER TYPE` line on its own, then the rest.)*
3. From **Project Settings → API**, note three values:
   - Project URL
   - `anon` public key
   - `service_role` secret key

## 2. Node crypto service

```powershell
cd server
copy .env.example .env     # then edit .env with your URL, service_role key, and a random SERVER_SECRET
npm install
npm start                  # -> listening on http://0.0.0.0:4000
```

## 3. Python AI service (now required for PDF question import)

Requires Python 3.10+ (install from [python.org](https://python.org) if needed).

```powershell
cd ai-service
pip install -r requirements.txt
# Optional — enables Claude-powered PDF parsing (hybrid). Without it,
# the service uses its built-in offline rule-based parser automatically.
$env:ANTHROPIC_API_KEY = "sk-ant-..."
uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8080
```

This service now does three things: per-copy fingerprinting, custody anomaly scoring, **and** NLP question extraction from uploaded PDFs (`POST /extract/questions`).

> **Hybrid NLP:** with `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` set, PDFs are parsed by Claude (model overridable via `AI_EXTRACT_MODEL`, default `claude-sonnet-4-6`); on any failure or with no key, it falls back to an offline regex/heuristic parser — so PDF import always works.
> If the AI service is offline entirely, fingerprinting falls back to local HMAC, but PDF import is unavailable (manual question entry still works).

## 4. App (mobile + web)

1. Edit [`mobile/src/lib/config.ts`](mobile/src/lib/config.ts):
   - `SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` from step 1
   - `CRYPTO_SERVER_URL` (the web browser case is picked automatically via `Platform.OS`):
     | Where the app runs | Value |
     |---|---|
     | Web browser | `http://localhost:4000` (automatic) |
     | Android emulator | `http://10.0.2.2:4000` |
     | iOS simulator | `http://127.0.0.1:4000` |
     | Physical phone (Expo Go) | `http://<your PC's LAN IP>:4000` (run `ipconfig`) — phone and PC on the same Wi-Fi |

2. Run it:

```powershell
cd mobile
npm install        # already done if you used the setup script
npx expo start     # scan the QR with the Expo Go app, or press "w" for the browser
```

   Or go straight to the web version:

```powershell
npx expo start --web    # opens http://localhost:8081 in your browser
```

   For a production web build: `npx expo export --platform web` outputs a static site to `mobile/dist/` that any static host (Vercel, Netlify, nginx) can serve.

> **Web tip:** two roles side by side is easy in the browser — open one of them in an incognito window so the sessions don't share storage.

## 5. Demo walkthrough (the full leak-proof lifecycle)

Create three accounts from the app's **Create account** screen (use the role tabs):

| Role | Example email |
|---|---|
| Teacher | teacher@demo.in |
| Paper Setter | setter@demo.in |
| Admin | admin@demo.in |

> **Invigilator / center accounts are not self-signup** — the Admin creates them in the *Centers* tab (code + password), and the invigilator signs in via the **"Exam center / invigilator login"** link.

Then run the lifecycle — ideally with two devices/emulators side by side to see the realtime updates:

1. **Admin** → *Exams* → **Schedule Exam** (e.g. "NEET UG 2026") with its **date and 2–3 daily slots** (each slot has a start/end time; duration is computed). Questions and papers can only exist under a scheduled exam, so this comes first. *(Teacher/Setter screens unlock live.)*
2. **Teacher** → *Upload* tab. Two modes, both feeding the same secure bank:
   - **Type one** — pick MCQ *or* Theory, set marks, and submit. *(Setter's pool updates live.)*
   - **Import PDF** — choose a PDF of mixed MCQ/theory questions → the AI service runs NLP and returns structured questions → review, deselect any, and bulk-import.
3. **Paper Setter** → *Compose* → pick the exam → title + select questions from that exam's bank → **Create & Seal** → enter a setter passphrase (≥8 chars — remember it!). Paper status: `SEALED (1/2)`.
4. **Admin** → *Papers* → **Co-sign** → enter an admin passphrase. *(Watch the setter's My Papers flip to `DUAL-SEALED` in real time.)* From this moment, nobody can decrypt the paper alone.
5. **Admin** → *Papers* → **Print Ceremony** → enter **both** passphrases + copy count. Each copy is minted with a signed QR + invisible fingerprint, and its chain of custody opens. The decrypted paper then opens in the **Print Preview** tab: a fully rendered, per-copy question paper with its signed **QR code** printed in the header — hit **Print this copy** (browser print on web, native print/share-as-PDF on mobile).
6. **Admin** → *Centers* → pick the exam → **Add Center** (name, **login code**, **password**, and which **slot** it runs — for the demo pick a slot starting ~25 min ahead). This **provisions a center login account**. Then **Allocate copies** to that center: those copies' QRs become center-wise in the database. *(Save the code+password shown — they're the invigilator's login.)*
7. **Center / invigilator login:** sign out → on the login screen tap **"Exam center / invigilator login"** → enter the **center code + password**. The center app is a single **Scan-in** screen: scan each paper's QR with the camera (native) or paste the QR payload (web). Each scan is signature-verified (forged QRs rejected), the copy leaves the pending list (`scanned_at` set — row preserved for the custody chain), and **a real-time notification fires to the Admin dashboard** (`COPY_SCANNED`).
8. **The reconciliation alarm:** leave at least one copy **unscanned**. The crypto service sweeps every minute and, ~20 min before the center's slot start, fires a **CRITICAL `UNSCANNED_COPIES` alert** on the Admin dashboard listing how many copies are missing at that center. *(Tune the window with `RECONCILE_WINDOW_MIN`.)*
9. **Admin** → *Custody* → *Copies* → tap a copy → advance it through checkpoints: `Dispatch → Arrive at Center → Deliver to Exam Hall`. *(The Live Feed streams every scan.)*
10. **The money shot:** tap a copy → **Report MISSING** → a CRITICAL alert appears on the Admin dashboard **instantly** via Supabase Realtime.
11. **Admin** → *Audit* → see the hash-chained, tamper-evident record of everything that just happened.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Fix |
|---|---|
| "Not configured yet" banner on login | Fill in `mobile/src/lib/config.ts` |
| Sign-up fails with "Cannot reach crypto service" | Sign-up goes through the Node server (accounts are created pre-confirmed — no emails, no Supabase mailer rate limit). Start the server first (step 2) |
| "Cannot reach crypto service" | Server running? Correct `CRYPTO_SERVER_URL` for your device type? Windows Firewall may need to allow Node on port 4000 |
| Sealing fails: "function digest(text, unknown) does not exist" | Run [`supabase/patch-1-digest-and-exams.sql`](supabase/patch-1-digest-and-exams.sql) in the SQL Editor (pgcrypto lives in the `extensions` schema; the hash-chain triggers needed it on their search_path) |
| Teacher's Upload tab says "No exams scheduled yet" | By design — the Admin must schedule an exam first (*Exams* tab); questions belong to an exam |
| Realtime not updating | Ensure the `alter publication supabase_realtime …` lines at the end of `schema.sql` ran without error |
| "This account is registered as X" on login | You picked the wrong role tab — roles are enforced, not cosmetic |

## Security model (demo vs production)

This is a fully working demonstration of the architecture. The honest list of demo simplifications (escrow window, LSB vs DCT watermarking, self-selected roles, plaintext question bank) and their production replacements is in [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md §7](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md).
